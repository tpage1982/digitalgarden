# Port Fray: The City of Tides and Tithes

The largest and busiest port on the continent, Port Fray is, at first glance, everything a grand fantasy metropolis should be. The air, thick with the smells of salt spray, fish guts, and foreign spices, is pierced by the cries of gulls and the bellowing of ship captains from a hundred different nations. Towers of stone and weathered wood climb over one another, vying for a view of the glittering Azure Expanse. Yet, for all its epic scale, to live and work in Port Fray is to understand the mundane, bureaucratic, and often absurd reality that keeps the gears of a great city grinding. It is a city where a dragon's legacy is managed by a committee that argues about luncheon expenses.

### The Golden Flame

The city's most famous landmark and the crown jewel of its skyline is The Golden Flame, a colossal lighthouse of obsidian and brass. It was constructed centuries ago by the drakona architect **Ukko**, who used his own fiery breath to forge its eternal flame. The light isn't merely fire; it's a beacon of concentrated hope, magically amplified to cut through the thickest fog and ward off the sea's more territorial monsters.

Ukko, now ancient and thoroughly unimpressed with "modern work ethic," still resides in the lighthouse's upper chambers. He serves as the "Founder-Emeritus on the Port Authority Council," a title he despises. He spends his days complaining about the quality of the brass polish, the quarterly "Flame Maintenance and Arcane Expenditure" forms he has to fill out in triplicate, and the constant stream of bards and tourists asking for his autograph. The official tour, led by a perpetually bored half-elf named Elara, makes a point to skip his floor entirely to avoid a lengthy, rambling lecture on "how things were better when we just *built* things instead of having meetings about building things."

### Points of Interest

*   **The Harbormaster's Office & The Queue:** Before any ship can dock, its captain must file paperwork at the Harbormaster's Office. This has resulted in a semi-permanent line of salty, irritable sailors and merchants that snakes for blocks. Known simply as "The Queue," it has its own micro-economy of food vendors, street performers, and professional line-standers. The office itself is a maze of cubicles where overworked clerks handle absurdly specific forms, such as "Form 7B: Unscheduled Kraken-Related Delays" or "Schedule C: Declaration of 'Probably Cursed' Cargo."

*   **The Adventurers' Mutual:** A massive, open-plan office space that serves as the headquarters for the city's largest adventuring guild. It functions less like a heroic order and more like a mid-level insurance company. Adventurers clock in, attend mandatory "Team-Building & Trust" workshops, and have their quest rewards subjected to numerous fees and taxes. The guild is run by a beholder in a magically tailored suit who insists on being called "Mr. Eyebright" and communicates primarily through passive-aggressive memos dictated to his army of goblin interns.

*   **The Gilded Ledger:** The financial district, where the real power of Port Fray resides. Dwarven bankers and elven venture-capitalists work side-by-side, financing everything from shipping ventures to high-risk dungeon delves. The district is known for its "hostile takeovers," which are sometimes, literally, hostile.

### Shops & Taverns

*   **The Salty Siren Bar & Grill:** A popular chain of taverns known for its watered-down ale, consistently mediocre "Admiral's Platter," and annoyingly catchy sea shanties played on a magical lute that never stops. It's where you go for a predictable, uninspired, but safe night out.

*   **Wands & Widgets:** A magic item shop run by a gnome named Pippin. He specializes in "low-stakes" magical items for the working professional: self-stirring cauldrons, quills that automatically correct spelling errors, and enchanted briefcases that are bigger on the inside. He's the top-rated seller of "Minor Illusions for More Engaging Presentations."

*   **The Groggy Goblin:** A true dive bar located under the pier. The place is damp, smells vaguely of regret, and is the only establishment in the city that will knowingly serve an ogre. It's here, over cheap, questionable spirits, that the city's best-kept secrets and most lucrative, off-the-books jobs are exchanged.

### The Temple of the Shattered Sky

Perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the harbor entrance, the Temple of the Shattered Sky is a chaotic structure of jagged stone, crackling stormglass, and copper spires that sing in the wind. It is dedicated to Rihanya, the goddess of storms, chaos, and magic. In a city utterly dependent on predictable tides and calm seas, the clergy of the Shattered Sky have carved out a vital and lucrative niche: they are the city's premier weather forecasters.

The temple runs the "Skywatch Service," offering tiered meteorological predictions. A basic, and often comically vague, forecast is shouted from the temple steps each morning for the public. However, for a hefty "donation," ship captains and merchants can subscribe to their "Tempest-Tier" service, which provides highly accurate, magically-derived shipping forecasts, storm warnings, and optimal route-planning to avoid rough seas.

The priests, a mix of frantic seers and shrewd business-folk, justify this commercialization through a creative interpretation of their goddess's tenets. In accordance with "Knowledge hoarded is power corrupted," all their raw magical readings are published daily on massive stone tablets at the temple's baseâ€”but in an arcane script so dense and complex it's useless to the uninitiated. True to "Let no mortal rule the tempest of truth," they operate independently of the Port Authority, a fact they leverage to avoid taxes and regulations. Worship often involves lightning-infused, deafeningly loud ceremonies during active storms, and offerings typically include not just coin, but detailed logs of maritime weather phenomena to feed their ever-evolving predictive models.
