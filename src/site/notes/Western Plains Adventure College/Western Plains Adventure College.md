# Welcome to the Western Plains Adventure College!

*"We're not saying other adventuring colleges are bad, but let's just say their graduates have a higher-than-average rate of being turned into lawn ornaments by angry gorgons."*

## So, You Want to Be an Adventurer?

Great. Fantastic. We're... thrilled to have you considering us. Here at WPAC (we're workshopping the acronym, feedback forms are by the suggestion box, which is not a mimic, we promise), we offer a top-tier, premium, artisanal education in dungeoneering, monster-slaying, and treasure-acquiring. 

We believe in a hands-on approach. You won't just read about mimics; you'll learn to spot them before they eat your lunch. Literally. It was a whole thing. Check the student handbook (Section 4, Subsection B: "Sentient Furnishings and You").

## A Word From Our Headmaster

Our esteemed Headmaster, **Archibald Fitzgerald**, a human wizard of some renown (mostly for his meticulously organized spell component pouch and his groundbreaking thesis on the optimal trajectory of a thrown firebolt for maximum coverage), has been leading this institution for over two decades. He apprenticed under the legendary Fitzban the Magnificent right up until Fitzban... well, he 'disappeared.' Vanished. Poof. Archibald stepped up, and the college has been running smoothly ever since. Mostly. 

*"We've only had three dragon-related incidents this semester,"* says Headmaster Fitzgerald, *"which is a new record low for Q3 and well within acceptable operational parameters. Our insurance premiums have only increased by 12%."*

## Our History & Rebranding

Formerly the 'Adventure Community College,' we've rebranded to better reflect our commitment to excellence and to justify the slight tuition increase. The new, state-of-the-art lecture hall was expensive, and the enchanted whiteboard markers don't pay for themselves.

The transition has been seamless, guided by Archibald's steady hand ever since the unfortunate and completely mysterious vanishing of his predecessor. We don't talk about it. It's a whole thing.
