### **Biography**

Susan Toadbrew, formerly Fitzgerald, arrived at the Western Plains Adventure College with a wealth of experience in "managing expectations" â€“ primarily those of her ex-husband, Headmaster Archibald Fitzgerald. After their rather public (and magically explosive) divorce, Susan decided to channel her formidable organizational skills and potent witchery into the thankless task of HR. She quickly transformed the department from a dusty closet filled with forgotten grievances into a slightly less dusty office filled with *properly documented* grievances.

Her office is a sanctuary of order amidst the chaos of WPAC, adorned with motivational posters featuring stern-looking imps and framed copies of the "Adventurer's Code of Conduct." Susan is a master of conflict resolution, capable of de-escalating a heated argument between a barbarian and a rogue with a single, well-placed glare and a perfectly worded HR policy citation. She's also surprisingly adept at turning troublesome curses into "teachable moments" for offending faculty members.

Her current relationship with Dreugath, affectionately known as "Drew," the Black Dragon who occasionally moonlights as a guest lecturer in "Advanced Hoarding Techniques," is the subject of much campus gossip. Susan, however, remains unfazed, often remarking, "He's a dragon, yes, but he's surprisingly good at remembering to take out the trash. And he *listens*."

### **HR Policies & Important Reminders**

1.  **Inter-Species Harassment:** WPAC has a zero-tolerance policy for inter-species harassment. This includes, but is not limited to: taunting goblins about their height, questioning a dwarf's beard-braiding techniques, or suggesting a dragon's hoard is "excessive."
2.  **Magical Mishaps:** All accidental polymorphs, uncontrolled fireballs, or unintended summoning of minor demons must be reported to HR within 24 hours. Failure to do so will result in a formal written warning and mandatory "Responsible Spellcasting" retraining.
3.  **Leave Requests:** All requests for "personal quest" leave must be submitted two weeks in advance, accompanied by a detailed itinerary and a signed waiver of liability. "Sudden urge to slay a lich" is not considered an emergency.
4.  **Dress Code:** While WPAC encourages individual expression, faculty and students are reminded that "battle-ready" does not equate to "barely decent." Please ensure all armor and attire meet the college's modesty standards.
5.  **Dragon-Related Incidents:** Any incidents involving faculty or students being accidentally incinerated, eaten, or turned into a new piece of jewelry by a certain black dragon should be reported immediately. Susan will handle it.
