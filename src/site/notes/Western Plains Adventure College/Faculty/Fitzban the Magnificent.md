**Biography & College History:**
Fitzban the Magnificent, a wizard of considerable (and self-proclaimed) renown, founded the Western Plains Adventure College with a vision: to professionalize the often-chaotic world of adventuring. "Too many promising careers cut short by a misplaced goblin or an improperly filled out dungeon requisition form," he once mused during a particularly dry faculty meeting. His goal was to create a structured environment where aspiring heroes could learn not just how to swing a sword or cast a spell, but also how to manage inventory, negotiate contracts, and, crucially, fill out their expense reports correctly.

The college, affectionately (or sometimes sarcastically) known as "WPAC," started in a converted barn and has since grown into a sprawling campus, complete with a surprisingly efficient administrative wing. Fitzban himself is a whirlwind of arcane energy and administrative paperwork, often found muttering about "synergy" between the martial and magical departments or lamenting the lack of proper "KPIs" (Key Performance Indicators) for dragon slaying. He's known for his impromptu "motivational speeches" in the common hall, which often devolve into complex analogies involving spell components and quarterly budget forecasts.

**Teaching Philosophy:**
Fitzban believes in a holistic approach to adventuring. While he champions the mastery of traditional arcane disciplines, he equally emphasizes the "soft skills" of the modern adventurer. "What good is a fireball," he often asks, "if you can't properly document its collateral damage for insurance purposes?" His curriculum includes mandatory courses in "Advanced Loot Management," "Cross-Cultural Monster Negotiations," and "Effective Team Dynamics in Dungeon Crawls." He encourages his faculty to integrate real-world (or rather, real-dungeon) scenarios into their lessons, often to the exasperation of the more traditional professors.

**Office Hours & Availability:**
Professor Fitzban holds open office hours every Tuesday and Thursday from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, provided he's not "strategizing" in his tower, attending an inter-planar conference call, or "optimizing arcane resource allocation" (which usually involves napping). Appointments are highly recommended and can be scheduled through his long-suffering administrative assistant, Grizelda, a half-orc with an uncanny ability to decipher Fizban's cryptic memos.

**Notable Achievements & Quirks:**
*   **The "Mana-gement" System:** Fitzban personally designed the college's intricate mana-tracking system, which, while revolutionary in theory, often crashes during peak spell-casting hours.
*   **The Great Goblin Incident of '23:** A minor administrative oversight led to a goblin horde being accidentally scheduled for a "team-building exercise" in the main quad. Fitzban insists it was a "valuable learning experience" for the students.
*   **Catchphrase:** Frequently heard saying, "It's not about the magic, it's about the metrics!"
*   **Coffee Obsession:** Has an unquenchable thirst for "extra-strong, ethically sourced" arcane-infused coffee, which he claims is essential for "optimal cognitive function."
