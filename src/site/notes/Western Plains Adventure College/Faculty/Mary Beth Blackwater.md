### **Biography**

Mary Beth Blackwater came to the Western Plains Adventure College after a brief but memorable career as a freelance "information retrieval specialist" (a term she prefers over 'Rogue'). After an incident involving a mislabeled golem, a cursed codex, and far too much screaming, she decided the quiet, predictable life of a librarian was a much safer career path. She was wrong, but she's adapted.

Ms. Blackwater runs the college library with the quiet efficiency of someone who knows exactly where all the secret passages are. She can spot a student using an *invisibility* spell to sneak into the Restricted Section from three aisles away and has a sixth sense for detecting forged hall passes. Her uncanny ability to appear silently behind anyone mishandling a rare manuscript has become the stuff of campus legend.

She maintains a professional, if slightly strained, relationship with Headmaster Fitzgerald. He approves her annual budget requests for acid-proof book covers and sound-dampening wards, and in return, she doesn't ask why the library has three different copies of "Necromancy for Dummies" checked out under his name.

### **A Note from the Librarian**

Welcome to the library. Please note the following for a productive and non-lethal visit:

1.  **Late Fees:** Overdue books may be paid for in gold. Alternatively, you may undertake a library-sanctioned quest to retrieve materials from... less-than-reputable prior borrowers. See the quest board next to the "Most Wanted" posters.
2.  **The Restricted Section:** It is restricted for a reason. It is not "a challenge." It is not "extra credit." Unauthorized entry will result in a temporary polymorph penalty, the duration of which is directly proportional to my mood. You have not lived until you've spent a week as a toad contemplating your poor life choices.
3.  **Noise:** Silence is mandatory. This includes, but is not limited to: magical duels, summoning rituals, loud proclamations of "I've found the loophole!", and spontaneous musical numbers.
4.  **Food and Drink:** Absolutely forbidden. The ink in some of these books is sentient and gets very hungry. You are not insured for that.

Read responsibly.
