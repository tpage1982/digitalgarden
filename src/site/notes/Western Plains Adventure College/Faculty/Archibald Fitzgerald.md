### **Official Biography**

Headmaster Archibald Fitzgerald has been the steadfast leader of the Western Plains Adventure College for over two decades. He began his career as the promising apprentice to the legendary, and famously eccentric, Fitzban the Magnificent. When Fitzban embarked on an unplanned and indefinite 'sabbatical' (from which he has yet to return), Archibald bravely stepped up to fill the leadership vacuum, ensuring a seamless transition for the institution.

Under his guidance, the college has entered a new era of stability and financial solvency. His key achievements include the successful rebranding from the "Adventure Community College" to the more prestigious WPAC, a statistically significant reduction in unscheduled dragon attacks on campus facilities, and the implementation of a new, multi-tiered tuition system that accepts payment in gold, rare artifacts, or binding magical oaths.

While his predecessor was known for flashy, world-altering spells, Headmaster Fitzgerald is renowned for his administrative prowess. His meticulously organized spell component pouch is a testament to his belief that true power lies not in raw magical energy, but in proper labeling and efficient resource management. He firmly believes that with the right paperwork, any threat can be neutralized.

### **A Memo from the Headmaster's Desk**

To all incoming and returning students,

Welcome to another exciting semester at WPAC! As we embark on this journey of learning, danger, and personal growth together, I want to emphasize our core values: safety, responsibility, and profitability.

Remember that the student handbook is not merely a suggestion; it is a binding document. Please pay special attention to the updated addendums regarding inter-planar travel and the proper disposal of cursed items. Our insurance does not cover 'soul-binding contracts with extra-dimensional entities' unless the proper forms have been filed in triplicate.

Please also respect that the West Tower remains sealed for archival purposes. It is not a suitable location for study groups, and rumors of 'lingering magical phenomena' are greatly exaggerated and not covered by your student activity fee.

Let's make this a successful and minimally-calamitous year. Together, we're not just adventuring; we're creating value.

Sincerely,

**Archibald Fitzgerald**
Headmaster, WPAC
