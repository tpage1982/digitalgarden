# Welcome to the Western Plains Adventure College!

So, you want to be an adventurer? Great. Fantastic. We're... thrilled to have you considering us. Here at WPAC (we're workshopping the acronym), we offer a top-tier education in dungeoneering, monster-slaying, and treasure-acquiring. We're not saying other adventuring colleges are bad, but let's just say their graduates have a higher-than-average rate of being turned into lawn ornaments by angry gorgons.

Our esteemed Headmaster, Archibald Fitzgerald, a human wizard of some renown (mostly for his meticulously organized spell component pouch), has been leading this institution for over two decades. He apprenticed under the legendary Fitzban the Magnificent right up until Fitzban... well, he 'disappeared.' Vanished. Poof. Archibald stepped up, and the college has been running smoothly ever since. Mostly. We've only had three dragon-related incidents this semester, which is a new record.

Formerly the 'Adventure Community College,' we've rebranded to better reflect our commitment to excellence and to justify the slight tuition increase. We believe in a hands-on approach. You won't just read about mimics; you'll learn to spot them before they eat your lunch. Literally. It was a whole thing. Check the student handbook.

Anyway, look through the course catalog. Try not to get intimidated by the 'Advanced Gelatinous Cube Navigation' syllabus. We have a payment plan.
